# Optimization Methods: Unconstrained and Constrained Approaches  

This repository explores various optimization techniques, both for unconstrained and constrained problems. The methods are implemented and visualized in a Jupyter Notebook, providing insights into their convergence and efficiency.  These methods have been studied as part of the MASD course.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The notebook is divided into two main parts:  

1. **Unconstrained Optimization Methods**  
   - Gradient Descent with Fixed Step Size  
   - Gradient Descent with Optimal Step Size  
   - Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient Descent  

2. **Constrained Optimization Methods**  
   - Projected Gradient Descent  
   - Exterior Penalization Method  
   - Uzawaâ€™s Algorithm  

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations and Comparisons  
Each method's performance is evaluated using contour plots and numerical results, comparing:  
- Convergence behavior  
- Number of iterations  
- Accuracy of the found solution
